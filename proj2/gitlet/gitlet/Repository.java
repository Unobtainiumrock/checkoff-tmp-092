     * Usage: java gitlet.Main add [filename]
     * <p>
     * Description: Adds a copy of the file as it currently exists to the staging area (see the description of the commit command).
     * For this reason, adding a file is also called staging the file for addition. Staging an already-staged file overwrites the
     * previous entry in the staging area with the new contents. The staging area should be somewhere in .gitlet. If the current
     * working version of the file is identical to the version in the current commit, do not stage it to be added, and remove it
     * from the staging area if it is already there (as can happen when a file is changed, added, and then changed back to itâ€™s
     * original version). The file will no longer be staged for removal (see gitlet rm), if it was at the time of the command.
     * <p>
     * Runtime: In the worst case, should run in linear time relative to the size of the file being added and O(log(N)), for N
     * the number of files in the commit.
     * <p>
     * Failure Cases: If the file does not exist, print the error message File does not exist. and exit without changing anything
     *
     * @param file A string representing the file we with to commit. If "." is provided, then it will iterate over all untracked files and add them.
     *             to the staging area.
