1) I recently moved and had a housing scare.
2) My partner's family caught covid, and it disrupted our workflow.
3) We produced valid code for valid prims algorithms in the previous lab, but there was error messages without explanations
as to why they were wrong. (Will prove via example outputs for given inputs of valid MST's in a future email w/ screenshots)
